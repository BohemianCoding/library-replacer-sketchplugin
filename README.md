# Replace Library Plugin

Allows you to replace a library in a Sketch file by replacing symbols, layer and text styles from an existing library with those from a new library.

This plugin is based on [Camilo](https://github.com/Pausansol/Camilo).

## Installation
 
### From a release (simplest)
 
- [Download](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/replace-library-sketchplugin/releases/latest) the latest release of the plugin
- Double-click the .zip file to extract the plugin
- Double-click `replace-library.sketchplugin` to install the plugin
 
### From source
 
- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies with `npm install`
 
## Usage
 
Open the Sketch file you want to replace the library and then go to _Plugins > Replace Library_. If the Sketch file references more than one library you will need to select the library you want to replace and the new library, otherwise you just select the new library.
